## Environment set up

Since you have your environment set up you can clone the repository and run in the project root directory
```
npm install
```
Since we are reorganizing the building process, there is something more you need to have a fully working Waves Client:
```
npm install -g grunt
npm install grunt
grunt distr
```
Those commands will prepare all required dependencies. Now feel free to open src/index.html in your browser.
